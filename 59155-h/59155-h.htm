<p>Chaco Canyon National Monument was established by
presidential proclamation in 1907, owing largely to the efforts of
Edgar L. Hewett, Director of the Museum of New Mexico and the
School of American Research, whose first of many expeditions
into the canyon was in 1902.</p>
<p>Pueblo Bonito, &ldquo;the pretty village,&rdquo; has been known by that name
since at least as far back as 1840, and was probably named by Spanish or
Mexican soldiers or traders.</p>
<p>Excavation of Pueblo Bonito was begun in 1896 by Richard
Wetherill who homesteaded in the canyon, and by George H.
Pepper of the American Museum of Natural History. The work
was financed by two wealthy young brothers from New York,
Frederick and Talbot Hyde, who formed the Hyde Exploring
Expedition for the purpose. In four seasons 190 rooms were
cleaned out. Research was resumed by a joint National Geographic
Society&mdash;U.S. National Museum expedition in 1921 under the
direction of Neil M. Judd, who in seven summers completed the
excavation of 600 or more rooms and 33 kivas, and made extensive
tests in the large trash mound, and in the plaza.</p>
<p>The Bonito Trail is about one-third of a mile
long.<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a>
Along it you will find numbered markers corresponding to numbered
paragraphs in this booklet. Please keep off all ruin walls.</p>

<p>Pueblo Bonito, probably the largest single prehistoric
Indian building in the Southwest at the time it was constructed,
represents the highest development of Anasazi architecture. Most
of the construction was between the years A.D. 1030 and 1079.
The bulk of the wall&rsquo;s thickness was made up of rough, unshaped
random stones laid in mud mortar. Then the walls were veneered,
inside and out, with the carefully fitted stone you see here. The
stone used for the facing, a hard, dense sandstone, was quarried
from a narrow band of rock at the top of the cliff behind the
pueblo. So much of this stone was used to build the great houses
of the canyon that most of it has been removed for a mile east
and west of Pueblo Bonito, but in other places the signs of ancient
quarrying are still evident.</p>

</div>
<p>The small, rectangular openings in this wall were vents for
air and light in the lower rooms. The round holes are sockets for
vigas, ceiling beams.</p>
<h3 id="c3">2</h3>
<p>The large, broken stones here and to your left are what
remain of Threatening Rock, a large vertical slab of native rock
which once stood separated from the cliff by a wide crack. The
people of Pueblo Bonito felt the threat of its fall, for using posts,
mud, and stone masonry, they attempted to shore up the rock, or
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
to prevent erosion of its base. Here you can see a remnant of that
early attempt. The Navajos, who were not here until long after the
last of the Anasazi departed, call Pueblo Bonito &ldquo;the place where
the cliff is propped up&rdquo;, and they relate a tale
about their predecessors pouring baskets of turquoise
and white shell behind the rock as an
offering to the spirits to prevent its fall. When the
huge slab finally came down in January 1941, no
turquoise was found, but it was discovered that
the Anasazi had placed prayer sticks behind the
rock. These are peeled and carved willow wands,
painted and decorated with feathers, which are
still used by Pueblo people somewhat in the way
altar candles are used.</p>

<p>The rock around you is sandstone of the
Cliff House formation, a member of the Mesaverde
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
group of sedimentary rocks laid down in
Cretaceous times&mdash;70 to 80 million years
ago&mdash;near the edge of a shallow sea. When
the shoreline retreated and the waters became
shallower, and fresh or brackish, the
sediments were in the form of carbonaceous
shale and coal which are exposed across the
canyon. The Indians made no use of the
coal as fuel, but jet and shale from that formation
were made into figurines, beads,
and pendants, and decomposed shales were
used for pottery clay and for mortar.</p>

<p>Here is an overall view of Pueblo Bonito and the more
than three acres it covers. The panels in front of you describe the
construction sequences. An existing southeast-facing pueblo was
used as the nucleus for the grander multi-storied Pueblo Bonito.
The symmetry of the ground plan indicates that a well-conceived
basic plan was adhered to throughout three generations of remodeling
and enlarging.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know the exact number of rooms the pueblo contained
because many of the upper walls had fallen during the
centuries it stood empty and abandoned, but sections of the rear
wall were known to be five stories high, and some estimates run
to 800 rooms. However, many of the rooms in the older section
were trash-filled to serve as footings for the rooms above, and
other rooms were destroyed to clear space for kivas, and it is
probable that no more than 600 rooms were usable at any one
time. The excavator, Judd, estimated a population of 1,000.</p>
<p>From here, too, you can see the pueblo in relation to its
canyon setting and to some of its sister communities. The deep
arroyo in the middle of the floodplain was probably a shallow
streambed bordered by sedges, willows, and cottonwoods. Otherwise
the environment was not much different from what we know
today. Garden plots, irrigated both from the arroyo and by runoff
water from the cliffs, covered much of the canyon bottom.</p>
<p>A relatively smaller population of Anasazi had inhabited
the canyon for at least 500 years when, with the building of
Pueblo Bonito and other large communal houses, the population
was greatly swelled. The increased demands for wood and water,
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
more intensive cultivation, and the heavy foot traffic on friable
soil undoubtedly placed a strain on the environment, but the
deterioration of resources alone doesn&rsquo;t explain the total abandonment
of the area at about A.D. 1300. It is likely that there were
political, or other social factors involved whose traces are hard to
find in the archeological remains.</p>

<h3 id="c6">5</h3>
<p>This broken section of wall shows its construction of a
core of rough stone faced with smaller, selected stones, each having
at least three plane surfaces. Note that the wall is thick at the
bottom where the entire weight was carried, but is narrower at
the top where less strength was needed. The tapering is evidence
of prior planning&mdash;the builders knew when they started that
they were going to build four to five stories&mdash;but the wall was
not erected as a single operation. As the height for each story
was reached, beams were built into the wall, and the ceiling was
covered to provide a platform from which to work while raising
the walls another stage.</p>
<h3 id="c7">6</h3>
<p>You are standing near the ceiling level of the ground
floor rooms. Rock debris and silting from the canyon wall has
buried the lower part of the house. By referring to the ground
plan at the front of the booklet you can see that this section
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
of the wall is a &ldquo;curtain wall&rdquo; with a narrow,
triangular space behind it. Visible in the masonry
are the butts of small poles used as tie rods that
bridge the opening behind the wall. The space was
not a room, but was filled to lend strength to the
juncture of the older western section and a new
arc of outside wall running east. At the top of
the wall to your right you can see timbers built
into masonry like reinforcing rods.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p05.jpg" alt="Construction detail." width="133" height="498" />
</div>
<p>At the foot of the cliff behind the ruin
are the remains of a kiva and a one-room house
built against the rock. There is an interesting
petroglyph cut into the sandstone.</p>
<h3 id="c8">7</h3>
<p>You may walk into this small ground floor
storeroom to inspect the original ceiling. The
doorway was once plugged with masonry, but it
was opened by an early explorer. This section of
the pueblo is part of the first construction of
Pueblo Bonito behind the older pueblo of the
A.D. 900&rsquo;s. Tree-ring dates from the Ponderosa
pine vigas indicate that the room was built in A.D. 1038. Peeled
willow sticks were laid across the beams and covered with juniper
bark, and finally about six inches of packed soil to make a floor
for the room above. The room to the left has not been excavated.</p>
<p>The next doorway you pass on your way to Station 8 is
now closed with a modern gate. The room behind it was used for
a storeroom by Richard Wetherill whose first camp was pitched
outside the wall of the pueblo in this vicinity. When Pueblo
Bonito was built there were 18 doorways in the rear wall, but
all were plugged up by the Indians at some later date so that
the only entry into the house was at the south wall of the plaza.</p>
<h3 id="c9">8</h3>
<p>The rooms surrounding you are part of the old, southeast-facing
pueblo, built between 919 and about 936, over and around
which the grander Pueblo Bonito was built 100 years later. Note
the cruder masonry and thinner walls. The vertical poles incorporated
into the wall in front of you represent an earlier method
of construction. Often the poles supported a matting or wattle
of small branches which served as lath to hold a thin wall of mud
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
plaster. Later the people used small posts as a frame for stacking
hand-molded adobe bricks or stones, and still later began to lay
ashlar courses in which the strength was gained by lapping stones
across the joints between stones in the course below. When Pueblo
Bonito was built, the eastern end of the old pueblo was leveled to
make way for new rooms, and some rooms at the southwest end
were torn out when kivas were put in.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>Hyde Expedition camped behind Pueblo Bonito, 1890&rsquo;s</i></p>
</div>
<p>Many of the old rooms were filled with trash and it is
possible that the smaller pueblo was not occupied when the new
builders started to work on the later structure. Eight or more of
the rooms (including the one you are standing in) had been used
as burial chambers for more than 90 individuals.</p>
<p>The burials that have been found in Chaco have been of the
people who preceded the builders of Bonito and the other great
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
pueblos, or of contemporaries of theirs from the many smaller
pueblos in the canyon, or of members of a small group that
moved into the canyon from the north after Pueblo Bonito was
largely, if not entirely, abandoned. So far archeologists have not
discovered how, or where, the considerable population that lived
in Pueblo Bonito, Chetro Ketl and other large houses disposed of
their dead.</p>
<p>The modern roofs in this area protect remains of original
ceilings.</p>
<h3 id="c10">9</h3>
<p>This open area is the plaza or courtyard. It served much
the same function as a town square where ceremonial dances and
other group activities took place. Also, when weather permitted,
much of the daily domestic work was done here&mdash;shelling corn,
twisting cordage, scraping hides, firing pottery, and fashioning
tools of stone, bone and wood.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p06.jpg" alt="Shelling corn." width="500" height="384" />
</div>
<p>The plaza was divided by a single row of rooms into two
courts. Many grinding stones were found in these rooms which
served as one of two community centers for mealing corn into
flour. Corn was ground on a large troughed stone, the metate
(meh-TAH-tay), with a smaller, loaf-shaped stone, the mano. The metates
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
were arranged in a line of bins where several women could work together.
Another milling center was in four adjacent rooms in the east wing.</p>
<h3 id="c11">10</h3>
<p>The round underground room, a bit over 45 feet in diameter
at the floor, is a great kiva which served as a religious center.
Its roof, supported by four rubble-filled masonry columns, was
9 feet 7 inches above the floor. Thirty-four niches around the
wall above the upper bench may once have held offerings of
jewelry and other valued materials, but were open and empty
at the time of excavation. The chamber was entered at the north
end by a series of stone steps. You may enter and examine in
detail a great kiva across the canyon at Casa Rinconada.</p>
<p>Another great kiva in the west court, and the division of
the plaza, suggests to some students that the people were divided
into two groups, each group responsible for certain ceremonies at
different times of the year&mdash;summer people and winter people&mdash;as
is true of many of the Rio Grande pueblos today.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig5">

<p class="pcap"><i>National Geographic painting by Peter V. Bianchi, February 1964</i></p>
</div>
<h3 id="c12">11</h3>
<p>The ordinary kivas let down into this raised terrace served
smaller groups than the great kiva. In today&rsquo;s Pueblo villages kivas
are used as meeting places by both male and female members of
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
curing societies, as workshops for making ritual equipment, for
dance rehearsal, and as sleeping places for boys while they are
receiving religious instruction.</p>
<p>Kivas were more numerous than great kivas&mdash;37 have been
identified in Pueblo Bonito&mdash;though not all were usable at one
time. The kiva on the left was razed. All the timbers were removed
and the open pit was used as a refuse dump by people in nearby
rooms.</p>
<p>An architectural trait peculiar to Chacoan kivas is the low
bench with from four to ten pilasters made of juniper logs buried
in the wall and extending horizontally onto the bench. The pilasters
supported the butts of log stringers which encircled the kiva.
The stringers held the weight of another, but smaller, circle of
stringers, and that circle still another, until 12 to 14 layers of poles
in ever-decreasing circles made a dome-like ceiling of cribbing. A
nearly intact roof in a nearby kiva was found to have used 350
timbers in its construction.</p>
<p>Close to the wall the ceiling was only about three feet above
the floor, but at the center of the room there was an eight to ten
foot clearance. The space between the outside of the roof-dome
and the wall of the kiva was filled with earth and rubble to level
off a flat court even with the level you are standing on. When
these kivas were all in use their presence was indicated only by
ladders protruding from rectangular openings which served both
as entryways and smoke holes.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig6">
<img src="images/p07.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="159" />
<p class="pcap">sub-floor vent</p>
</div>
<p>The trench in the floor, once covered with slabs of stone,
was an air duct. Rising heat from the fire in the round pit pulled
fresh air through the duct and down a vertical shaft just outside
the kiva wall to provide ventilation.</p>
<p>The smaller kiva on your right, as you proceed along the
trail, is unusual in having four tall masonry pilasters. Rather than a
cribbed roof, it probably had a flat roof of horizontal timbers to
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
give it an even seven-foot clearance over the entire space.</p>
<h3 id="c13">12</h3>
<p>These ground floor rooms were used for storage and were
reached from the living rooms above them by means of ladders
through open hatchways in the ceiling.</p>
<p>Doorways were closed by leaning large, flat slabs of ground
sandstone against sloping collars of masonry in the jambs, or by
suspending matting from small sticks in the lintel.</p>
<h3 id="c14">13</h3>
<p>The fire-reddened walls in this room resulted from a fire
that destroyed the ceiling. The unburned area near the floor shows
that the fire occurred after abandonment
of the rooms. The earthen
floors of the rooms above had
leaked through and piled up
against these walls. Tree-ring dates
from charred beams fallen to the
floor indicate construction at
about A.D. 1100&mdash;one of the
last additions to be built. The
room had been left empty except
for three scrapers made from
deer bone. Each was beautifully
inlaid with turquoise, jet and shell.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p07a.jpg" alt="Scrapers made from deer bone." width="400" height="432" />
</div>
<p>Note the diagonal doorway in the southeast corner of the
room above.</p>
<h3 id="c15">14</h3>
<p>The three doorways in this room have been successively
modified by adding new sills, lintels, and secondary jambs, sloped
to accommodate door slabs.</p>
<p>The doors may seem small but they were not made for ease
of passage, but rather for reduced heat-loss and to make them
easier to close off. In fact, the doors of the great Chacoan pueblos
were unusually large for Anasazi houses. Typical doorways for the
period were narrower and with high sills.</p>
<p>The mud plaster on the south wall is original.</p>
<h3 id="c16">15</h3>
<p>The doorway in the east wall was plugged with masonry.
Such sealed-off doors were common and probably for a variety
of reasons as the use of rooms changed and apartments were
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
rearranged. Sometimes grain-storage rooms were temporarily
closed with quickly-laid, crude masonry and mortar to render
them rodent-proof.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig7">
<img src="images/p08.jpg" alt="" width="593" height="800" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Series of doorways</i>  <span class="small"><span class="hst">[photo by Hal Malde]</span></span></p>
</div>
<p>Almost ten feet below this floor is the floor of a kiva which
was part of an earlier version of Bonito&rsquo;s town plan. It was filled
and buried by this later construction.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<h3 id="c17">16</h3>
<p>The T-shaped doorway, though not common, is found
from Colorado and Utah south into the mountains of northern
Mexico. We can only speculate about its purpose. Of the 32
T-doors remaining in Pueblo Bonito, most are exterior doors
facing kiva courts.</p>
<h3 id="c18">17</h3>
<p>This well-preserved ceiling is the original one. The fresh-looking
sawed ends and notches in the beams is where sections
were removed for tree-ring dating. The small round holes, less
destructive of the timber, are made with a hollow auger bit which
removed a core&mdash;the preferred method of taking samples. Seven
dates were obtained from the cores and sections in this room.
Three of them were cutting dates, indicating the last year of the
growth of the trees: A.D. 1077, 1078, and 1079. The construction
date was probably 1079 or 1080.</p>
<p>Though this section of the pueblo was three stories high,
some of the ground floor rooms were used as living quarters equipped
with firepits. Relatively few firepits were found in the ruin,
most of them in one story sections, in the open on the edges of
the plaza, or next to an outer wall in a kiva courtyard, but there
was evidence in the fill of the rooms that others had existed on
the upper floors and on the terraced roofs.</p>
<h3 id="c19">18</h3>
<p>Above and to the left of the rooms you have just left is
another corner window. On the morning of the winter solstice in
December the rays of the rising sun shine through this window
and strike the opposite corner of the room behind it, a fact that
is probably more than coincidental. We know that in the 11th
century Indians in Mexico were making solar and lunar observations
and calculations that were in some respects more sophisticated
than were possible in most of Europe.</p>
<p>The long low ridge in front of the pueblo was the trash
dump. It was built up of ashes from the firepits, floor sweepings,
construction debris, bones, food refuse, human waste, scraps
from craftwork, broken pottery&mdash;everything that was no longer
of any use. With only a little imagination one can picture the
mound with a band of small, naked children playing &ldquo;king of the
hill&rdquo;, and with foraging turkeys, and dogs burying or digging up
bones.</p>
